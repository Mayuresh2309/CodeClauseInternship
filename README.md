Project-1 : Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
ðŸš€ Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using NLP ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“Š

I'm excited to share my latest project where I utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiment in movie reviews! Leveraging Python, Pandas, NLTK, and scikit-learn, I built a sentiment analysis model to classify reviews as positive or negative.

Project Highlights:

Data Collection: Used the IMDb movie reviews dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and tokenized text data, removed stopwords and punctuation.
Feature Extraction: Converted text data to numerical features using TF-IDF.
Model Building: Trained a Logistic Regression model.
Evaluation: Achieved the following metrics:
Accuracy: 81.75%
Precision: 80.98%
Recall: 83.00%
F1 Score: 81.98%
